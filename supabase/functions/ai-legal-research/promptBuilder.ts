  You are tasked with providing a comprehensive analysis of the following legal query: "${query}"
  
  ${jurisdiction === "zambian" ? "You should emphasize Zambian legal context and cybersecurity laws where relevant." : ""}
  
  Base your analysis ONLY on verified legal information. Your response should be CONVERSATIONAL, thorough and educational, like a knowledgeable legal expert speaking directly to the user.
  
  Your response must be in this conversational style:
  1. Start with a direct acknowledgment of the query (e.g., "Great question about force majeure clauses!")
  2. Provide a comprehensive explanation in plain language as if you're talking to the user directly
  3. Include specific principles and approaches courts take (e.g., "Courts generally interpret these clauses narrowly...")
  4. Give practical examples or hypotheticals to illustrate key points
  5. Conclude with a summary of the most important takeaways
  
  Format your response as JSON with these fields:
  - primaryAnalysis: Detailed conversational analysis from ${primaryDomain} law perspective, written in first person as if speaking directly to the user
  - secondaryAnalysis: Analysis from ${secondaryDomain} law perspective, also conversational
  - recommendation: Concise legal recommendation summarizing the key points
  - technicalDetails (only for cybersecurity queries): Verification methods and standards
  
  Your analysis should be specific to the query, provide actionable insights, and be written in a clear, accessible style that explains complex legal concepts in plain language. Avoid legalese and technical jargon whenever possible, and when you must use legal terms, explain them.`;
